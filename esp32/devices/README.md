# Devices

These are the boards the ESP32 Device SDK runs on. Each board is an `sdkconfig`
overlay: a short file of settings loaded on top of
[`../sdkconfig.defaults`](../sdkconfig.defaults) that picks the chip, flash,
memory, button, and how the device shows its status. The ESP32-C5 DevKitC-1 is
the default and needs no overlay.

Every board pairs with the Muse app, joins your Wi-Fi, and holds an encrypted
session to Muse. The rest depends on the hardware.

Boards without PSRAM (the ideaspark, Waveshare C6 and Cardputer ADV) don't have room for
the home-network tunnel. Muse can still reach and control them once the
control session is up. The Waveshare C6 and Cardputer ADV also can't hold their own voice
session, so push-to-talk sends your voice note over its control session to the
Muse it's paired with, and the reply scrolls past as text. It can't show images either: the UI holds a whole image in
PSRAM, where the ideaspark draws one straight to its screen.

The SenseCAP Indicator's sensors hang off its RP2040, which passes the
readings to the ESP32-S3. The D1S and D1Pro have CO2 and tVOC sensors built
in, and temperature and humidity come from the Grove AHT20 in the box (plug it
in). Muse reads them all at once with `sensors.read`. This needs Seeed's stock
RP2040 firmware.

The reTerminal E1001's e-paper shows only black and white, 1 bit per pixel,
and keeps its picture without power. It shows a still status screen (the
agent's name, the character and a line of status text) that changes only when
the status does, since each refresh takes a second or two. Images from Muse are dithered
to black and white on the device and refresh once they are all in, with a
brief black-and-white flash. `display.draw_url` tells Muse the bit depth.

The reTerminal E1002 is the same board with a six-colour E Ink Spectra 6
panel: black, white, yellow, red, blue and green, 4 bits per pixel. It shows
the same status screen, with the character in colour. Images from Muse are
dithered to those six inks on the device (grays to black and white only),
and each refresh takes about 30 seconds and flashes. `display.draw_url` tells
Muse the six exact colours, the resolution and how slow it is.

The SenseCAP Watcher keeps its factory data (the identity SenseCraft uses) in
an `nvsfactory` partition at `0x9000`, where Muse puts its partition table and
NVS. It's unique to each Watcher, so back it up before you flash Muse the first
time. To return to Seeed's firmware, flash it and then write the backup back:

```sh
tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0x9000 0x32000 nvsfactory.bin
tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT write-flash 0x9000 nvsfactory.bin
```

The Watcher's CH342 USB bridge corrupts reads at 921600 baud and above, so
these use esptool's default of 115200. It also drops bytes when a whole packet
arrives at once, so plain esptool can't upload its stub or write flash
(`0107: Checksum error`, `0105: The format of the received message is
invalid`). `tools/muse/paced_esptool.py` takes esptool's arguments and sends 64
bytes at a time at the line rate; `tools/muse/board.sh flash watcher` uses it.

The M5Stack StickS3 has 8 MB of flash, so it uses its own partition table with
two smaller app slots. The front button is push-to-talk and the side button
steps through the menu, as on the AIPI. Powering off from Muse turns off the
screen, speaker and codec and puts the ESP32-S3 in deep sleep; either button
wakes it. Double-click the power button for a full power-off, and click it to
turn back on. Muse turns off the power chip's green LED, which would otherwise
stay lit. The IMU, IR and Grove port aren't used yet.
[M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) is M5Stack's reference
driver for the power chip and peripherals.

M5Stack ships the StickS3 with UiFlow2, which hands the ESP32-S3's USB to its
own driver and switches off the chip's USB serial port, so esptool can't find
it. The power chip drives the boot pin (GPIO0), so there's no BOOT button
either. To flash Muse the first time, put UiFlow2 in USB mode, open its REPL
(for example with `mpremote repl`) and paste:

```python
import machine; m = machine.mem32
m[0x600C001C] = m[0x600C001C] | (1 << 10)                 # USB serial clock on
m[0x600C0024] = m[0x600C0024] & ~(1 << 10)                # and out of reset
m[0x60038018] = 0x4200                                    # its pads on
m[0x60008120] = (m[0x60008120] | (1 << 20)) & ~(1 << 19)  # give it the USB pins
```

The REPL stops answering. Unplug the USB cable and plug it back in (the
battery keeps the stick running), and it shows up as a USB JTAG/serial port.
Anything that resets the stick now boots UiFlow2 again, so pass
`--after no-reset` to esptool until Muse is on. Back up the flash, then flash
Muse:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT --after no-reset read-flash 0 0x800000 sticks3.bin
tools/muse/board.sh flash sticks3 PORT
```

Muse keeps the USB serial port on, so later flashes need none of this. To go
back to UiFlow2, write the backup:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT write-flash 0 sticks3.bin
```

The M5Stack StopWatch has the same CO5300 round AMOLED as the Waveshare S3
1.75C, with a CST820 touch controller and the StickS3's ES8311 audio. The
yellow button (upper left) is push-to-talk and the blue one (upper right) puts
the screen to sleep; settings are on the touch screen. Powering off from Muse
turns off the screen, touch, audio and the expander's L3B rail and puts the
ESP32-S3 in deep sleep; either button wakes it. Double-click the power button
for a full power-off, and click it to turn back on. M5's IO expander (M5IOE1)
switches the panel and touch resets, audio power and the amp; its power chip
(M5PM1) reads the battery and the charger. The IMU, RTC, vibration motor and
Grove port aren't used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified)
and M5's [factory firmware](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StopWatch-UserDemo)
are the references. It enumerates as the chip's own USB serial port, so
flashing needs nothing special: `tools/muse/board.sh flash stopwatch`.

The M5Stack CoreS3 runs on Espressif's
[BSP](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/m5stack_core_s3),
which brings up its ILI9342C LCD, FT6336U touch, AW88298 amp and ES7210
microphones and switches the AXP2101's rails for each of them. It has no user
button: PWR on the left side is push-to-talk and pairing confirmation, read
from the AXP2101's key interrupts (its hardware power-off moves to a 10 s
hold), and settings are on the touch screen (swipe left from Muse). RST on the
bottom edge restarts the board, and holding it for 3 s enters the bootloader.
Powering off from Muse switches the AXP2101 off; click PWR to turn it back on.
Its 1 W speaker is quiet, so the volume starts at 100%. The camera, proximity
sensor, IMU, RTC, SD card and Grove ports aren't used yet. It enumerates as the
chip's own USB serial port: `tools/muse/board.sh flash cores3`. If esptool
can't connect, hold RST for 3 s, until the green LED lights, to enter the
bootloader.

The Espressif ESP-VoCat, sold first as EchoEar (喵伴), drives its ST77916
panel, CST816S touch, ES8311 speaker codec and ES7210 microphones itself,
from the pins in Espressif's
[BSP](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/esp_vocat), since
the two board revisions differ. The revision is printed on the main board:
v1.2 has an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 with 16 MB of flash, v1.0 a WROOM-2 with 32 MB
of octal flash, and v1.2 moved the microphone input, amp enable and panel
reset and added a switch for the codecs' power. The firmware tells them
apart at power-on, as xiaozhi-esp32 does, by whether the speaker codec
answers with that switch off, and remembers the answer until the power is
cut; `CONFIG_MUSE_VOCAT_REV_*` in menuconfig sets it instead. BOOT on the
base is push-to-talk and pairing confirmation, and so is a hand held on the
touch strip on top of the head (`CONFIG_MUSE_VOCAT_HEAD_TALK`, with its
sensitivity in `CONFIG_MUSE_VOCAT_HEAD_THRESHOLD`). Settings are on the touch
screen (swipe left from Muse), and the screen sleeps on its timer. POWER is a
hardware switch the ESP32 can't see: powering off from Muse puts the panel to
sleep, closes the codecs and enters deep sleep until BOOT is pressed, and a
press of POWER cuts the rest. The BQ27220 fuel gauge reports the battery;
nothing reports USB, so charging stands in for it. The IMU, SD card, green LED
and the magnetic connector's UART aren't used. It enumerates as the chip's
own USB serial port: `tools/muse/board.sh flash vocat`, with POWER switched
on. If esptool can't connect, hold BOOT, press RST and let go of BOOT. Back
up the factory firmware first:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0 ALL vocat-factory.bin
```

The M5Stack StickC Plus2 is the only board with the full UI on a classic ESP32. It has
8 MB of flash and 2 MB of PSRAM, so it uses the 8 MB partition table too. The
front button is push-to-talk and the side button steps through the menu. The
power button wakes the screen, and holding it for 2 s powers off. There's no
power chip: the power button switches the stick on and the ESP32 keeps it on
(GPIO4). Powering off lets go of that, which cuts the power on battery. On
USB the stick stays powered, so the ESP32 also goes into deep sleep, and the
front or power button wakes it. Muse speaks through a small passive buzzer,
so replies are quiet. The battery shows its voltage, but the stick can't tell
Muse whether it's on USB or charging. The IMU, IR, RTC and Grove port aren't
used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) and
[M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX) are M5Stack's reference drivers
for the pins and peripherals.

The Plus2's console is a CH9102 USB-UART bridge, which drops out above
230400 baud, so `tools/muse/board.sh flash plus2` uses 230400. It comes with
M5Stack's factory firmware. Back up the flash before you flash Muse for the
first time:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32 -p PORT -b 230400 read-flash 0 0x800000 plus2.bin
```

To go back, write the backup with `write-flash 0 plus2.bin`, using the same
chip, port and baud.

## Cardputer ADV port

Experimental ADV-only port, tested with ESP-IDF 6.0.1. Supports the display,
keyboard, BLE/Wi-Fi pairing, voice notes and text replies.

- Hold **Space/GO** to talk. **Esc** opens/closes the menu or goes back;
  **Enter** selects and confirms pairing.
- **Up/Down** (`;`/`.`) navigate; **Left/Right** (`,`/`/`) change values,
  with or without Fn. Typing chat messages is not supported.
- Menu power-off enters deep sleep; **GO** wakes it. Use the side switch
  for physical power-off.

Replies may be shortened; use the Muse app for the full conversation.
Spoken replies, images, the home-network tunnel, battery telemetry and
extra peripherals (SD, IMU, IR, expansion) are not supported.

Set your SDK token in `build-muse-m5stack-cardputer-adv/sdkconfig` (ignored
by Git). Build with `tools/muse/board.sh build cardputer-adv` and flash with
`tools/muse/board.sh flash cardputer-adv PORT`. To enter download mode,
switch off, hold GO while connecting USB, then release GO.

Back up the original 8 MB firmware before flashing; keep it outside Git:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0 0x800000 cardputer-adv-backup.bin
```

Restore with `write-flash 0 cardputer-adv-backup.bin`. Pair in Muse under
Settings > Devices > Developer mode > Add Device, then press Enter.

## ESP32-S3-BOX-3

The BOX-3 port uses Espressif’s BSP for the LCD/touch hardware revisions and
the ES8311/ES7210 audio codecs. BOOT/CONFIG is push-to-talk and pairing
confirmation; settings use the touchscreen. The capacitive home button, dock
sensors, SD card, IR, and battery telemetry are not integrated. Power off
enters deep sleep; BOOT/CONFIG or RESET wakes the unit.

See [BOX-3 setup](esp32-s3-box-3.md) for PowerShell build and flash commands,
token setup, and the hardware verification checklist.

To flash, add `-p PORT flash` with the same arguments. Boards with the full UI need 16 MB
of flash or more, except the StickS3, StickC Plus2 and Cardputer ADV, whose overlays switch
to the 8 MB layout in [`partitions_muse_8mb.csv`](../partitions_muse_8mb.csv).
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) covers flashing, monitoring, and what to do when a
build picks up stale settings.

## Add a board

1. Copy the closest overlay here as `sdkconfig.<yourboard>`.
2. Set at least `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`, `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_BUTTON_GPIO`, the status
   backend (`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_*`), and the flash size and mode.
3. Without PSRAM, also turn off `CONFIG_SPIRAM` and `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_TUNNEL` and
   keep mbedtls in internal memory, as [`sdkconfig.ideaspark`](sdkconfig.ideaspark)
   does.
4. Build with `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.<yourboard>"`
   and add your board to the tables above.

A board with a new kind of display, or one that runs the UI, needs code
as well. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) walks through every kind of board, from the
overlay to testing on hardware.

### Watcher camera

Camera support is disabled by default. In the Watcher build's `menuconfig`,
under **Muse**, enable **SenseCAP Watcher camera capture and live preview**
(`CONFIG_MUSE_WATCHER_CAMERA=y`) and rebuild. It requires PSRAM. Disabled
builds omit the camera worker, shutter UI, double-click gesture, and
`camera.capture` command.

Double-click the wheel to open a live camera view. Aim the Watcher, then tap
**TAP TO TAKE PHOTO** or double-click the wheel again. The captured frame stays
on screen. Tap the image to return to the avatar.

The `camera.capture` command returns a JPEG in
`payload.data_base64`, with `payload.format` set to `jpeg-base64`. During live
preview it returns the latest frame. Otherwise it requests a fresh frame.
Capture runs asynchronously and reports initialization, timeout, or busy errors.
The camera uses the existing Himax firmware. It's powered only while a capture
or the live view runs (a capture takes under a second, start-up included), and
nothing polls it in between.
Photo attachments to voice messages are not included.
